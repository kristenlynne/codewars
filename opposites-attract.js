// Timmy & Sarah think they are in love, but around where they live, they will only know once they pick a flower each. If one of the flowers has an even number of petals and the other has an odd number of petals it means they are in love.

// Write a function that will take the number of petals of each flower and return true if they are in love and false if they aren't.

console.log(lovefunc(2, 2)); // false
console.log(lovefunc(0, 1)); // true
